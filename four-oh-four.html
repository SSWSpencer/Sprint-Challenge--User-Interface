          <p>It appears either you've reached a page you're not supposed to be on, or our programmers are slacking! (probably the latter!) We're constantly working to update our website for the most user-friendly experience. Please come back later!</p>

            <p>We value our visitors. However unforunately, we don't have copyright claims in our professional budget! That's why our designers use only the most professionally-coyright-safe rendition of popular memes. However, none of this excuses the fact that you're on an unfinished webpage!</p>

            <p>The internet is a treasure trove! We believe all links deserve to go somewhere, even if that somewhere is nowhere! Unfortunately for you, the last link you clicked on leads to here: nowhere.</p>

        <h2>Why This Should Be Worth Stretch Points</h2>
  
        <p>Am I breaking the 4th wall with this? Probably. Is my presentation unprofessional? Aboslutely. Did I basically just copy-paste the "about" page, changing the text and images around? Probably. But why should this be worth stretch points? Because our developers went the extra step. All websites need a 404 page for when the developers are working on a tight schedule, and only have 21 minutes left to design an entirely new page! Would you rather click on a link that doesn't work, leaving you questioning the unknown, or would you rather have the developers be open about the fact that they're working on getting closer to a finished product, but the time restraint left them on a last-minute crunch to just let the user know that their efforts to click a link were not in vain?</p>
